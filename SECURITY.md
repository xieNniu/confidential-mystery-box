## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Confidential Mystery Box seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### ⚠️ Please Do Not

- **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
- **DO NOT** exploit the vulnerability for malicious purposes

### ✅ Please Do

1. **Email** the project maintainers with details:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

2. **Wait** for our response (we aim to respond within 48 hours)

3. **Work with us** to understand and fix the issue

4. **Receive credit** in our security acknowledgments (if desired)

## 🔍 What We Consider a Security Vulnerability

### High Priority
- Smart contract vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Private key exposure or theft
- Unauthorized fund access or withdrawal
- Gateway communication manipulation
- Critical frontend vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)

### Medium Priority
- Information disclosure
- DoS attacks
- Wallet connection issues
- Non-critical smart contract bugs

### Low Priority  
- UI/UX issues without security impact
- Documentation errors
- Performance issues

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
- ✅ **NEVER** share your private key or seed phrase
- ✅ Always verify you're on the correct network (Sepolia)
- ✅ Double-check contract addresses before transactions
- ✅ Start with small amounts when testing
- ✅ Keep your MetaMask and browser updated

### For Developers
- ✅ Never commit `.env` files or private keys
- ✅ Use `.gitignore` properly
- ✅ Review all dependencies for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Run security analysis tools (Slither, MythX)
- ✅ Test thoroughly before mainnet deployment

## 🔐 Smart Contract Security

### Audits
- **Status**: Currently unaudited (Testnet only)
- **Mainnet**: Will require full security audit before deployment

### Testing
```bash
# Run security tests
npx hardhat test

# Run static analysis (if available)
npm run analyze
```

### Known Limitations
1. **FHE Technology**: Still in development, may have undiscovered vulnerabilities
2. **Gateway Dependency**: Relies on Zama's gateway service availability
3. **Testnet Only**: Not audited for production use

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deployment:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No hardcoded private keys
- [ ] `.env` not committed
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Access controls properly implemented
- [ ] Event emissions for critical actions
- [ ] Reentrancy guards in place
- [ ] Integer overflow protections
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanism (if needed)

## 🚨 Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Pause contract operations (if possible)
   - Secure affected systems
   - Notify users if necessary

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and transactions
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Resolution**
   - Develop and test fix
   - Deploy patched version
   - Communicate resolution

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security measures
   - Share learnings (if appropriate)
   - Improve processes
